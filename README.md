# ling-library-ucsc
Repository for the LRC library's searchable database 


Allows a user to access the entire public repository of books, journals, grammars, and references available in UCSC's Linguistics Library, saved in a Google Sheet. 

Also implements a basic search function over the sheet to return likely matches based on an input sequence.
